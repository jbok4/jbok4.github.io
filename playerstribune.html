  <h3 class="se-content">Hi, I'm Jaclyn!</h3>
  <p>I want to work at The Players' Tribune. In fact I'm so excited about the prospect, that I wanted to show you the kind of value I'd bring to the team. I've had an idea about a project to bring into the fold-––one that showcases the personalities involved in specific sporting events. This puts together your key brand (the human side of professional athletes), with timely occurrences in sport.</p>

  <p>Please take a look at my preliminary idea, and I would love to get in touch when you're done!</p><br><br>
