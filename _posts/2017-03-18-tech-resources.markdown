**Utilizing Your Free Online Resources**

After graduation, I was at first concerned about how I was going to continue to broaden my tech skills after completing the Learn Curriculum ... But that fear only lasted about 2 hours. 

The easiest resource is to locate is the additional content that Learn.co offers with some different learning tracks. 

But don't fret if you were never a Learn student, there is so much more online. 

Some tasks I have been working through this past month:

1. Google around for "how to build (insert kind of app you're interested in here) with Rails(or JS, Angular, React, etc)" and follow some code alongs. It's a great way to see how many different styles people have. It's also a good way to learn some new skills while also expand your tech vocabulary and understand differing layouts and functionality you might not have been privvy to previously.

2. <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">Hacker Rank</a> 
 has daily tech problems to solve. Some of these are quite hard, or unfamiliar to a new developer, and I find it always challenging. This is definitely a help when preparing for tech interviews and real world tech jobs, as you're thinking about how to logically solve a problem, and then how to solve it the most efficient and clean way.

3. <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com">Interview Cake</a>
Similar to hackerrank they also have daily problems, PLUS some additional information, like  <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/coding-interview-tips">this page</a> of Coding Interview Tips

4. <a href="https://www.hiredintech.com/">Hired In Tech</a>
Which offers free courses designed to help developers ace your tech interviews,
master algorithm design, system design, and much more by learning with theoretical lessons and practice tasks.

5. <a href="https://github.com/rails-camp/ruby-coding-exercises">Daily Coding Exercises in Ruby</a> on github.  I came across this amazing find while watching a youtube video by ...

6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/edutechional">edutechional</a> 
These are very fun and short logic Ruby questions. Things you might find on a Ruby Tech Interview and that can give you confidence to know you will do well. 

Good Luck!
