**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. I'm writing this blog post in a markdown file (.md) or (.markdown) in Sublime. 

When web designers and developers approach a project, they build styles into the project. Those styles dictate how basic elements, like headers and links will appear.

At its core, Markdown is a super simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and so on to plain text. It was originally designed to be an easy alternative to HTML, and allows people to create web pages with no HTML experience—but it's also a great way to organize notes, to-do lists, and other things. It has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor. The end goal is a minimalist writing system that you can use to get your thoughts down, and then export them elsewhere without worrying too much about the appearance.

When using Markdown, people who edit content can focus on the words and later the designer can focus on making them pretty. Markdown does an excellent job at drawing a line in the sand, so editors and designers can play nice together. When a designer pushes a new style to the website, the styles are consistently reflected across the whole site, so the design stays fresh and up to date with browser caveats and features.

Markdown is widely accepted by developers and editors, so it's the best choice for implementing best practice.

Markdown was initially created by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as a simple way for non-programming types to write in an easy-to-read format that could be converted directly into HTML.

Markdown uses a very simple formatting syntax to accomplish the same thing that HTML or Rich Text Formatting does. The difference is that it's simpler than HTML and you don't have to worry about opening and closing tags. It also doesn't have all of the menus associated with most text editing programs. To format text, Markdown uses punctuation and characters you're already familiar with.

For example, to create a header you use hashtags. So, "# HEADLINE" is a large header. "## HEADLINE" would be a little smaller, "### HEADLINE" would be smaller still.

Want to make a bulleted list? Just type in a "-" "+" or "*" before any item and the list is created automatically. No need to start it, end it, or deal with funky formatting.

To add emphasis, you can either use an asterisk (*really?*) for italics, or two asterisks for bold (**really!**).

To Recap:  Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

Here are some of the most used

##HEADERS
```
# This makes an <h1> tag. 
## This is an <h2> tag.
#### This is an <h4> tag.
```

##EMPHASIS
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```

##BLOCKQUOTES
```
As Grace Hopper said:
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.
As Grace Hopper said:
 I've always been more interested
 in the future than in the past.
 ```

##BACKSLASH ESCAPES
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which
would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formatting syntax.

\*literal asterisks\*
*literal asterisks*

##Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:
```
\ backslash
` backtick
* asterisk
_ underscore
{} curly braces
[] square brackets
() parentheses
# hash mark
+ plus sign
- minus sign (hyphen)
. dot
! exclamation mark

```
