<p>A blog from a designer who speaks developer-ese. The challenge with something this simple is achieving elegance through typography, spacing, balance, weight and color. But also through the things you experience, like how the project flows and how the data is stored/retrieved. What is the Users' Experience and now the other side of the coin, how to  improve upon it via software engineering? Adding Jquery, Ajax requests, Handlebars, Angular and ember to base applications and bring them to their full potential. Bring them to LIFE. Those are the Jedi skills you need to do it well, and the ones I aspire to each day.</p>
