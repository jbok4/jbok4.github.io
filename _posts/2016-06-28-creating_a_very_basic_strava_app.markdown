For my 'Build an MVC Sinatra Application' final project, I had to build my very own (from scratch) program with user accounts and validations. Like all previous final projects in Learn, I was very overwhelmed at the beginning of this and not sure how to begin, or even what kind of program I wanted to build. The previous 2 projects I found to be both challenging and time consuming, and hoped this wouldn't hang me up and frustrate me for too long the way those did.

I was quite happy to find that along the way of building the 2 previous programs (Fwitter, and NYC Sinatra) I had learned a LOT! All of a sudden Sinatra and the complicated MVC setups were making sense to me. Hallelujah!

MVCs at first were so daunting to me, that I watched the lectures online over and over again. I couldnt seem to grasp what the get requests and post requests in the controller actually did. Once I was able to start playing around with them using shotgun, I finally began to understand how it all fits together. 

As a cyclist, creating an app to track cycling rides of each user and their friends/fellow users seemed like the easy choice in the end, I need to learn to stop overthinking everything. I had already created a simplistic version of twitter.com, which forged my understanding of how twitter works under the hood. Why not do the same for Strava.com? 

It turns out that in practice this programs design is similar in structure to the fwitter lab, only needing to add some more components. Namely error and failure.erb's and some additional structures to the base equations. The fun part of this lab was watching it work when implementing new data, and adding in some css structure so that it actually looks halfway decent. I would really like to spend some more time on the css and design of this, but perhaps thats for a later date.
