Well, I finished! Even as Joe Burgess told me the words "Congratulations You've Graduated!" it seemed surrealâ€“It took an hour or so to sink in. Man, what a ride it has been! 

After every step completed, around the next bend was the next big challenge to conquer. And step by step learning all along the way, I finally crossed the finish line.

But now that I have graduated - I still have so much to learn. Currently I'm working on tackling questions for the technical interviews. There's a whole science to the algorithm questions they will ask, and armed with a great work ethic honed from the Flatiron School's Learn.co program (where there is always the next project waiting for you in the wings) I was able to hit the ground running. Up next will be a series on Technical Interview Questions and hopefully I'll learn some useful info along the way and share it with you!
