<p>A blog from a designer who speaks developer-ese. The challenge is achieving elegance through typography, spacing, balance, weight and color. But also through the things you experience, like how the project flows and how the data is presented after the user inputs it. What is the Users' Experience and now the other side of the coin, how to improve upon it via software engineering? Adding Javascript, Jquery, Ajax requests, Angular and React to base applications and bring them to their full potential. Bring them to LIFE. Those are the Jedi skills needed to do it well, and the ones I aspire to each day.</p>
