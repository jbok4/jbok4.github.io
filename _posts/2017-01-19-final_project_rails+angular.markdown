Project: Make a full-stack app, combining rails/JSON with an angular frontendâ€“that can speak to each other. Wow. Where to even begin? I had so many questions. I took a few weeks to do some online tutorials. wrap my brain around the problem and my lack of experience building with angular (and zero experience with how to work with angular+rails together, then watch as many youtube codealongs as I could for angular, until I finally felt I was ready to take a stab at it. 

**4 false starts later - I had it! My idea** 

I would create an app database for people to easily find the championships and awards their professional sports teams have won. All in one easy list. It would work similarly to wikipedia in that anyone can add in more data, and it relies on the public to fact check and grow. Rails would cover the backend and store the data as JSON and angular would pull the data from JSON/rails and display it to the user. Easy right?

To be honest, setting up this project with rails and bower was a breeze. I have Brigan Enser to thank for that. He had a <a href="https://medium.com/@briganenser/connect-rails-angularjs-618642683205#.dxiu1jis1">wonderful post</a> that I came across and since follow for each new angular+rails project I make: 

... because connecting rails and angular is not THAT simple if you don't know what you're doing. 

The hard part came when implementing all the powerful aspects of angular into my project, and remembering what they all were and how to make them all work together. I ended up taking it slow, and doing things a couple different ways to try to have some practice with each. More on that in a later post...

Probably the coolest part of angular is how easy it is to display lists of data, and also how easy it is to create a search filter and validations. 

Things that took forever in rails, now take a few words and work automagically in angular. So while it's quite time consuming to create new controllers, factories and pull in the data, the reward is in: 
1. how speedy the site loads
2. how easy it is to manipulate the data
3. how well angular and rails work together

I was surprised at how simple it seemed to make a rails project with JSON now, after having such a hard time with that originally (for the last big project). Setting up the rails backend using active-model-serializers is a breeze. Especially when you can forget about the views and forms on the rails end, and use angular for that. 

Basically after initially using Brigans tutorial to setup the connected app, then its right into making the migrations and models for rails. Once you have that complete, then rake db:migrate and add a few items in the console, to make sure its working properly, and setup the ApplicationController to `respond_to :json`  

In the controller your methods for your nested resource should look something like this:

```
class AwardsController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :set_award, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_action :set_team, except: [:index, :show]

  def index
    awards = Award.all
    render json: awards
  end

  def create
    @award = @team.awards.build(award_params)
    if @award.save
      render json: @award
    else
      render json: { errors: @award.errors.full_messages }
    end
  end

  def edit
  end

  def show
    team = Team.find_by_id(params[:id])
    render json: award
  end
```
... next step is to setup the relationships between the models (assuming you have some nested resources), and then to create some serializers to handle the data. 

```
class AwardSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :team_id, :title, :year, :content

  belongs_to :team

end
```

**and thats it!**
When you go to your localhost:3000/teams the JSON for the teams index as well as the awards that are nested for each team will all show up.
