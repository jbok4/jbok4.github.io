5 Years ago, out of a need to speak in code as to communicate better with web developers at my job as an Art Director, I began taking classes at the 3rd Ward School in Web Development–this not only helped me to translate between the developer and the client, it also helped me to design more functional pages, now knowing what the limitations were and how to circumnavigate them. 

I followed up those 3rd Ward classes with classes at SVA for Information Architecture and Interaction Design, learning the step-by-step process of quantitatively thinking through a project from the idea phase to sketch, to implementation.

I have utilized all these acquired skills to build responsive websites and those few projects have been the most fun and fulfilling work I have done in my career. Recently I've concluded that I've reached my ceiling as a developer unless I delve in full-time to hone my skills and foster my knowledge, because the more I experience about software/web development the more I fall in love with it.  

Last fall I began a continuing education class at the Flatiron School: Intro to Web Development, where I refreshed and gained further knowledge of HTML and CSS, and learned many new things, like Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery. Learning my first programming language is the hardest thing I have ever done. I had to learn to use my brain in a completely different way from anything else I have learned in my life. That is what is so frustrating and rewarding about it. And what a great thing to have immediate gratification once it does work - to see a functioning program!

I took my Instructor–Jon Grover–up on his challenge/offer to TA the next session of the class. He told me that being a TA would completely advance my understanding of the material and take it to the next level. He was absolutely correct about that. I think the 2nd time around I got more out of the class than most of the students (which is not criticizing them, thats just how much my understanding jumped). 

Having to teach someone else how to do something, and talk about it out loud just cements your understanding in different ways you couldn't imagine. I would enter the class each session and be so nervous that I wasn't going to be able to help anyone, and leave after that same class feeling entirely confident about my experience and knowing that I helped a few students to garner a deeper understanding as well. 

There are surely many moments like that to come, I experience them almost daily in the Learn program, and it still feels absolutely incredible to pass each hurdle, and to look back weeks later and shake my head in astonishment that something so simple in hindsight seemed so daunting. I can only hope that this continues to be my process as I go.
