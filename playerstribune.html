      <p>I want to work at The Players' Tribune. In fact I'm so excited about the prospect, that I wanted to show you the kind of value I'd bring to the team. I've had an idea about a project to bring into the fold-––one that showcases the personalities involved in specific sporting events. This puts together your key brand (the human side of professional athletes), with timely occurrences in sport.</p>

      <p>Please take a look at my preliminary idea, and I would love to get in touch when you're done!</p><br><br>

      <p>There’s a tremendous amount of talent in our game. My advice to young golfers may be cliché, but it’s still incredibly important: Don’t try to fix something that isn’t broken. Golfers on the PGA Tour are at the highest level because they’ve stayed true to their game.</p></br>
      <p>"Sometimes, I think back to my childhood in Edgerton, Wis., and wonder how the heck I got to where I am today. I was just a simple kid, running around town with my pals and helping my dad at his shop, Stricker Electric."<br> <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/2016-6-16-steve-stricker-golf-letter-to-pga-tour-professionals/">Read More From Steve</a></p>
