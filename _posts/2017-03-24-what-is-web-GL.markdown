WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is the new standard for 3D graphics on the Web, It is designed for the purpose of rendering 2D graphics and interactive 3D graphics. It is derived from OpenGL's ES 2.0 library which is a low-level 3D API for phones and other mobile devices. WebGL provides similar functionality of ES 2.0 (Embedded Systems) and performs well on modern 3D graphics hardware.

It is a JavaScript API that can be used with HTML5. HTML5 has several features to support 3D graphics such as 2D Canvas, WebGL, SVG, 3D CSS transforms, and SMIL.

WebGL code is written within the ``<canvas>`` tag of HTML5. It is a specification that allows Internet browsers access to Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) on those computers where they were used.

An American-Serbian software engineer named Vladimir Vukicevic did the foundation work and led the creation of WebGL.

##Advantages of WebGL
**Here are the advantages of using WebGL −**

JavaScript programming − WebGL applications are written in JavaScript. Using these applications, you can directly interact with other elements of the HTML Document. You can also use other JavaScript libraries (e.g. JQuery) and HTML technologies to enrich the WebGL application.

Increasing support with mobile browsers − WebGL also supports Mobile browsers such as iOS safari, Android Browser, and Chrome for Android.

Open source − WebGL is an open source. You can access the source code of the library and understand how it works and how it was developed.

No need for compilation − JavaScript is a half-programming and half-HTML component. To execute this script, there is no need to compile the file. Instead, you can directly open the file using any of the browsers and check the result. Since WebGL applications are developed using JavaScript, there is no need to compile WebGL applications as well.

Automatic memory management − JavaScript supports automatic memory management. There is no need for manual allocation of memory. WebGL inherits this feature of JavaScript.

Easy to set up − Since WebGL is integrated within HTML 5, there is no need for additional set up. To write a WebGL application, all that you need is a text editor and a web browser.
